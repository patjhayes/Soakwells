## 🌐 Deploy to Streamlit Cloud

### Step 1: Access Streamlit Cloud
1. Go to [https://share.streamlit.io/](https://share.streamlit.io/)
2. Sign in with your GitHub account (patjhayes)

### Step 2: Deploy New App
1. Click **"New app"**
2. Fill in the deployment form:
   - **Repository**: `patjhayes/Soakwells`
   - **Branch**: `main`
   - **Main file path**: `soakwell_dashboard.py`
   - **App URL**: `soakwells` (suggested)

### Step 3: Advanced Settings (Optional)
- **Python version**: 3.9+ (will be auto-detected)
- **Requirements**: Will use `requirements.txt` automatically

### Step 4: Deploy
1. Click **"Deploy!"**
2. Wait for deployment (usually 2-5 minutes)
3. Your app will be available at: `https://soakwells.streamlit.app`

## 📋 Deployment Checklist

## 🎯 Expected App Features Live on Streamlit Cloud

### Dashboard Capabilities
1. **File Upload**: Upload multiple .ts1 hydrograph files
2. **Soakwell Analysis**: 
   - Interactive parameter controls
   - Standard size selection (0.6m - 1.8m diameter/depth)
   - Multiple unit configurations (1-30 units)
   - Real-time performance visualization
   - Comprehensive solver for optimal configurations

3. **French Drain Analysis**: 
   - Pipe diameter selection (225-450mm)
   - Trench geometry customization
   - System length optimization (10-500m)
   - Mathematical modeling with Manning's equation
   - Darcy's law infiltration analysis

4. **Comparative Analysis**:
   - Side-by-side performance comparison
   - Cost-effectiveness analysis
   - System recommendations
   - Detailed reporting

5. **Visualization**:
   - Interactive Plotly charts
   - Flow rate analysis
   - Storage dynamics
   - Efficiency metrics
   - Comparative performance plots

## 🐛 Troubleshooting Common Deployment Issues

### If Deployment Fails:
1. **Check logs** in Streamlit Cloud dashboard
2. **Verify all imports** work in cloud environment
3. **Check file paths** - ensure no Windows-specific paths
4. **Dependencies** - verify all packages in requirements.txt

### If App Loads but Features Don't Work:
1. **File upload issues**: Check file size limits (200MB max)
2. **Performance issues**: Large datasets may need optimization
3. **Plot rendering**: Plotly dependencies should work automatically

## 📞 Support & Next Steps

### After Successful Deployment:
1. **Test thoroughly** with your actual .ts1 files
2. **Share URL** with colleagues for feedback
3. **Monitor usage** through Streamlit Cloud analytics
4. **Update as needed** by pushing to GitHub (auto-deploys)

### Repository Management:
- All future updates: Push to GitHub `main` branch
- Streamlit Cloud will automatically redeploy
- Monitor app performance and usage metrics

## 🎉 Success Metrics

Your deployment is successful when:
- ✅ App loads at https://soakwells.streamlit.app
- ✅ File upload accepts .ts1 files
- ✅ Soakwell analysis runs without errors
- ✅ French drain integration displays in sidebar
- ✅ Comparative analysis generates results
- ✅ All plots render correctly
- ✅ System recommendations appear
