ðŸš€ Dashboard Performance Optimizations for Large File Batches
=============================================================

## Problem:
Dashboard hanging when processing 24 .ts1 files simultaneously

## Solutions Implemented:

### 1. File Selection Interface
âœ… **Warning for >10 files**: Alerts user about performance implications
âœ… **File selection widget**: Allow users to select subset of files (default: first 5)
âœ… **Batch processing recommendation**: Suggests analyzing â‰¤10 files at a time

### 2. Progress Tracking
âœ… **Progress bar**: Visual indication of processing status
âœ… **Status text**: Shows current file being processed (e.g., "Processing file.ts1 (3/24)")
âœ… **Sequential processing**: Files processed one at a time with feedback

### 3. Error Handling
âœ… **Try-catch blocks**: Individual file errors don't crash entire analysis
âœ… **Error reporting**: Clear messages when files fail to process
âœ… **Graceful degradation**: Analysis continues with successful files

### 4. Performance Controls
âœ… **Plot limiting**: Slider to limit number of detailed plots displayed
âœ… **Memory management**: Reduced cache size (50 entries max)
âœ… **Selective visualization**: Option to show only summary tables for large datasets

### 5. User Experience Improvements
âœ… **Clear feedback**: Progress indicators and status messages
âœ… **Performance guidance**: Recommendations for optimal file counts
âœ… **Flexible workflow**: Users can process files in manageable batches

## Recommended Workflow for Large Datasets:

### Option 1: Batch Processing
1. Upload all 24 files
2. Select 5-10 files for initial analysis
3. Review results and optimize parameters
4. Process additional batches with optimized settings

### Option 2: Staged Analysis
1. Process critical/representative storms first (5-10 files)
2. Identify optimal soakwell configurations
3. Run remaining files with best parameters
4. Focus on summary tables rather than detailed plots

### Option 3: Parameter Optimization
1. Use subset of files to test different soakwell sizes
2. Compare cost-effectiveness across scenarios
3. Apply best configuration to full dataset

## Performance Tips:

### For Large File Sets (>10 files):
- âœ… Use file selection to process in batches
- âœ… Limit individual plots (use slider control)
- âœ… Focus on comparison charts and summary tables
- âœ… Disable individual scenario plots for initial screening

### For Detailed Analysis:
- âœ… Process fewer files with full visualization
- âœ… Use optimized parameters from batch analysis
- âœ… Generate detailed plots only for final scenarios

## Memory and Speed Optimizations:
- **Caching**: Limited to 50 entries to prevent memory overflow
- **Sequential processing**: Prevents simultaneous calculation overload
- **Error isolation**: Failed files don't affect successful analyses
- **Progressive feedback**: User sees results as they're generated

## Expected Performance:
- **1-5 files**: Fast, full visualization (< 30 seconds)
- **6-10 files**: Moderate, recommend plot limiting (1-2 minutes)
- **11-24 files**: Use batch selection, summary focus (process in stages)

The dashboard now gracefully handles large datasets while maintaining analytical power for focused studies.
